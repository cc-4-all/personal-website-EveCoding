        is 11 years old. I am pescetarian.  I like cats because they are cute but that's the only reason why I like them. I am questioing my sexual and romantic orientations but I think my orientation is aroace. 
        I am passionate about Languages, Science, Art, Activism and making The Media a better place. I am passionate about Languages, Science, Art,Activism and making The Media a better place.
        I created Proud in June because June is the current month as I create this and because I strongly support Pride and LGBTQIA+ people to the point where I create Pride stuff, even outside of June.
        I believe inclusivity is very important and that people who are racist, homophobic, sexist, able-ist, ageist, are discriminatory in any other way or support any form of negative discrimination are foolish.
