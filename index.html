        is 11 years old. I am pescetarian.  I like cats because they are cute but that's the only reason why I like them. I am questioning my sexual and romantic orientations but I think my orientation is aroace. 
        I am passionate about Languages, Science, Art, Activism and making The Media a better place. I am passionate about Languages, Science, Art,Activism and making The Media a better place.I strongly support
        Pride and LGBTQIA+ people to the point where I create Pride stuff, even outside of June. I believe inclusivity is very important and that people who are racist, homophobic, sexist, able-ist, ageist, are
         discriminatory in any other way or support any form of negative discrimination are foolish.

          <h4>I love languages and learning new languages because they are useful for travelling, exploring other cultures and communicating with speakers of that language.
             No language is useless! I love Science because it tells how everything in the world works e.g Our bodies, The Periodic Table, Gravity and everything outside of 
             the world e.g The Solar System. I love art because you are free to do and create anything you want. I love Activism, especially for human rights because everyone
             deserves equal rights and i also like activism to save the environment because the environment is important. I love making the Media a better place because The 
             Media needs a little cleaning, by a little, I mean a lot. I like making the media more inclusive by creating concepts for animations that will be public and 
             finished when I am older.</h4>
